# Airlines-Analysis-project-HADOOP
This project involves analysing the airline datasets to solve the problem statements using HADOOP.

There are multiple ways to approach this problem such as PIG, Map Reduce algorithms etc.
I'm using the HIVE approach. It's the most popular and widely used approach when it comes to analysing datasets within Hadoop!


Problem Statements:

Find list of Airports operating in the Country India
Find the list of Airlines having zero stops
List of Airlines operating with code share
Which country (or) territory having highest Airports
Find the list of Active Airlines in United state


In this use case, there are 3 data sets:

Final_airlines, routes.dat, airports_mod.dat
